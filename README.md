# Augmented-Reality-Keyboard
In this project, a virtual keyboard is created which is operated by pointing a key on a virtual grid using camera. First a grid is keyboard grid is made. A random is chosen and made into a physical pointer. This is obtained by thresholding. Every time the pointer stays above a key for a given interval, the key is clicked and the input is saved.

SUBLIME TEXT IS SUGGESTED TO BE USED.

RUN THE range_det.py for the pointer color

**SINGLE FINGER INPUT**
